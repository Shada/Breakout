1. The header files for GLEW must be located in 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\Include\um\gl\" in windows

compiled lib-files need to be in 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\Lib\win8\um\x86"

This must be set up in the installation.

2. for Linux GLEW must be compiled and then the files needs to be put in the correct directories
(<insert directory paths here>)

3. Same thing goes for GLFW files
